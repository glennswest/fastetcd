# CLAUDE.md — fastetcd

Project-specific context. Cross-project rules live in `../CLAUDE.md`.

## Project summary

Rust implementation of the etcd v3 wire protocol. Wire-compatible gRPC.
Multi-node Raft from day one. Importer for existing etcd BoltDB data.
Focused on low resource overhead and predictable latency.

## Version

**`0.6.0`** — `ETCD_*` env var drop-in compat (falls back to etcd's
env names when `FASTETCD_*` is unset), a systemd unit
(`deploy/systemd/fastetcd.service`, autostart + unconditional
auto-restart) and rpm/deb packaging (`crates/server/Cargo.toml`
`[package.metadata.deb]` / `[package.metadata.generate-rpm]`) that
bundle all three binaries as static `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`
builds — avoids baking in a glibc-version requirement from the
packaging host. Verified end to end on dev.g8.lo (Fedora 43):
`dnf install` / `dpkg -i` both create the `fastetcd` system user,
enable, and start the service automatically.

Previous: **`0.5.0`** — Kubernetes-ready: grpc.health.v1.Health for
service-mesh probes, a Helm chart at `deploy/charts/fastetcd`,
real `fastetcd-ctl` client (put/get/del/snapshot-save), README
rewrite. Only remaining gap from the v0.1.0 era is the openraft
0.10 upgrade for real `MoveLeader`.

## Architecture pillars

- **Storage**: trait-first abstraction (`KvStore`) with two first-class
  engines selectable at runtime: `redb` (default, cross-platform) and
  `iouring` (Linux, `glommio` + `O_DIRECT` + custom WAL; behind cargo
  feature `iouring`).
- **Consensus**: `openraft` — core, not optional. Single-node is a
  cluster-of-one.
- **gRPC**: `tonic` + `prost`, generated from vendored etcd `.proto` files.
- **Async runtime**: `tokio` for the gRPC frontend and Raft node;
  `glommio` runtime is internal to the iouring engine.
- **Logging/tracing**: `tracing` + `tracing-subscriber`.

## Work plan

Tracked live in the Claude task system. Snapshot of the order:

1. Project scaffolding (done)
2. Cargo workspace + crate skeletons
3. Vendor etcd protos, wire up tonic codegen (done)
4. Design `KvStore` trait + implement redb engine
5. MVCC state machine over `KvStore`
6. openraft integration (log storage trait + redb impl, state machine adapter)
7. Raft peer transport (gRPC) + discovery
8. KV gRPC service
9. Watch service
10. Lease service
11. Maintenance + Cluster services
12. iouring engine implementing `KvStore` (Linux-only, cargo feature)
13. Migration tool from etcd BoltDB
14. Benchmarks: redb engine vs iouring engine vs upstream etcd

## Constraints & rules

- **Wire compatibility is the bar.** If unmodified etcd v3 clients don't
  work, the feature isn't done.
- **No v2 HTTP API.** Deprecated upstream; not in scope.
- **Linearizable reads by default** (read-index), serializable opt-in.
  Match etcd's semantics, not "close enough."
- **All writes go through Raft.** No direct state-machine writes from gRPC
  handlers, even for "internal" things like lease expiry — those go
  through Raft too so they survive failover.
- **Compaction-correctness is non-negotiable.** Revision history truncation
  must coordinate with watchers and raft log compaction.
